This project culminates my first sprint under the 
ALX Software Engineering Programme.

In This project, I have implemented a simple shell based on
Thompson's shell.

This simple shell was developed by the undelying prowess of C
programming language.

The simple simple shell can handle the following:

- Basic shell commands and arguments

- PATH

- exit command

- env
